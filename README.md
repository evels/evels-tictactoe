# evels-tictactoe

Add JavaScript so an actual tic足tac足toe game can be played starting with a blank board. Each click on the board should alternate between X and O until someone wins or the game ends in a tie.

####Bonus
- Use CSS to add more detail, animations or responsive design to the wireframe above
- Allow for more than one independent tic足tac足toe board to be on the same page
- Add the ability to restart a game after it has ended
